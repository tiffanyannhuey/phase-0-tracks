# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows us to see a timeline of revisions to files and merge revisions made by one or more people. It is helpful because it lets multiple people work on a file/files at the same time and manages all the changes so that we can see it in a timeline and roll back the timeline if it's needed.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy of your project to work on and add your own code. You would create a new branch from the master branch so that it preserves the working condition of the master branch.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point for your files. A good commit message should be specific and descriptive to the changes that were made. 
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file, and then those branches are merged together. Git has trouble understanding which change should be used, so it writes a special block into the file that contains the contents of both versions where the conflict occurred.
