# How to tackle jQuery

1. Compare jQuery to another programming language that I know (It pretty much is Javascript but want to see how jQuery was simplified). I'd also try to compare this language to Ruby since I have a stronger foundation with Ruby. To do this I can type in "Javascript vs. jQuery" or "Ruby vs jQuery"
2. Compile a list of cheat sheets for jQuery or common jQuery actions, and bookmark them. 
3. Find some free online resources that will provide challenges to jQuery so that I can have some practice with it. 

# Reflection Notes

1. When typing in jQuery vs. Javascript the articles that I read gave some background on how jQuery was created. This was helpful in understanding the context but not necessarily how to use jQuery. Searching Ruby vs. jQuery pulled up several results on how jQuery differs from Ruby on Rails, but again not much information regarding how to use jQuery. 
2. I saved a few cheatsheets that provided some common methods for jQuery. The cheatsheets are useful to refer to but didn't provide a foundation on how to start. 
3. I found a good article [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/) that walked through the basics. In addition, I found a free practice tutorial [TryjQuery](http://try.jquery.com/)
