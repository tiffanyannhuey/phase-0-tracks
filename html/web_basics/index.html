<h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>I live in San Diego, and there's so many reasons why I love this city. Some of my favorite things about San Diego are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Beaches</li>
    <li>OMG the Mexican food...especially California burritos</li>
    <li>If you feel outdoorsy, in addition to beaches there are mountains and deserts an hours' drive away</li>
    <li>It's so sunny year-round that when we get any type of weather, people don't know how to deal...<em>at all</em>. Literally, the tolerance level is between 72 and 80 degrees</li>
    <li>A booming coffee culture for the coffee aficionado...or addict</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I love showing new people around town. If you want to know more (or just say hi), visit my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/87thuey">Facebook</a> page.</p>
